        <p><font color = "#8E5CC2"> 
            Computer Science has many areas of focus and there ate a few that I feel strongly about:
        </p>

        <p><font color = "#8E5CC2"> 
            <strong>The Cloud: </strong>I love the way the Cloud provides for the cliental. It feels as through the Cloud so much more can be accomplished 
            and created into something that really feels as though it can be transformed through the client’s needs. I love the way we can 
            see how the cloud develops based on needs and preforms into something that I would love to see how to grows and changes. The way 
            IBM has been handling the cloud and their explanation of it was really something that my attention and I would love to expand my 
            knowledge on it more. 
        </p>

        <a href = "https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/cloud-computing"> Cloud Computing </a>

        <p><font color = "#8E5CC2"> 
            <strong>Learning Programing Languages:</strong> I would love to continue to learn and develop programs in as many languages as I can. 
            The way that the languages come together and differ always interest me and inspire me to see the way that the same programs can differ 
            in the other languages. I love being able to learn new languages syntax and see what changes through the languages. I am a big a fan of
            growing my knowledge when it comes to Computer Science, and this is one of the things that helps me grow. I feel super confident in
            learning them, quick and trying to create programs with them as I try to go.
        </p>

       <p><font color = "#8E5CC2"> 

           <strong> The Analysis of Algorithms:</strong> Currently I am taking a course focusing on the way that Algorithms are designed and 
           developed, and it truly has peaked my interest in that area of Computer Science. A lot goes into putting the best possible foot forward
           when it comes to the timing in a program. The way that this connects to Software and creating the best possible program really has me 
           thinking about what could be best for the program.
