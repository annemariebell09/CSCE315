           <li><strong>Square List:</strong> 
               This Project takes a Doubly Linked List of Linked List and consolidates the number list according to the specifications given in
               the projects Read Me. I am specifically proud of this project because it was my first Java project and was created in two in a half
               weeks while learning Java for the first time. It was incredibly challenging but still gave so much learning opportunity and growth 
               through the process. 
           </li>
           
           <li><strong>String List Calculator:</strong> This project takes a string calculation and gives the answer to the equation
               as if it, were an integer calculation. This project was the first program created at Texas A&M in my Major. I hold this one
               close to my heart because it was challenging and looking back on it I can see a lot of growth in the way I program and the 
               knowledge that I gained through that class. (Shout out to Ritchey for that)
           </li>

           <li><strong>Made a Microprocessor:</strong> This project was creating a virtual Microprocessor and converting simple matrix 
               addition and sorting program in C to assembly Language to run on the microprocessor. This project was my first hardware class,
               and proposed a lot of challenges. We were put on a team and unfortunately lost a team member and all of their work in the last week 
               of the project. Somehow, we still managed to pull as much as we could together to get it to run as best as we could. The learning 
               process is still one to remember.
           </li>
           
           <li><strong>ENGR 102 Respiratory:</strong> This respiratory contains a learning process for Python. All of the programs contain the idea
                of the learning process behind a language.   
           </li>
           
           <li><strong>CSCE 314 Respiratory:</strong> This respiratory contains the learning process for three languages, Haskell, Scheme and Java. 
               Java only touches the surface of the language due to the focus in the Square List project. Haskell and Scheme were learned in the process
               of learning the grammars behind a lot of the languages.
